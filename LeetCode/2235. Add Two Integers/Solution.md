# 2235. Add Two Integers

## Intuition

I first looked at the inputs that are given to the program. I walked through a simple version of the problem in my head and then in pseudocode.

## Approach

I take the 2 inputs, add them together, and return the sum.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:
O(1)

- Space complexity:
O(1)
